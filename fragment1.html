    In this video, we explore key Christian perspectives on consciousness with a focus on Anglicanism. 
    Anglicanism does not preoccupy itself with defining consciousness in abstract terms; instead, it emphasises 
    the process of sanctification and self-transformation. Drawing on the teachings of Wesley, Nissa, and John of the Cross,
    we see that as the self matures through spiritual practice, prayer, and sacramental participation, consciousness 
    itself matures over time. Worship, sacraments, and liturgical rituals allow believers to engage both 
    human and Divine time, fostering moral reflection and spiritual growth. In this way, Christian consciousness 
    is understood not as a static state but as an ongoing process shaped by temporal experience and Divine 
    interaction. While the human time is largely linear, marked by decay and change, the Divine time is not bound
    by the clocks. Thus, although Anglicanism delegates the definition of consciousness to philosophy and science, 
    it engages with the formation and transformation of experienced self through acts, sacraments and the study of Scripture.

  <h2>Answer to the Research Question:</h2>
  <p>
    In Christianity, and specifically Anglicanism, consciousness is not statically defined. Anglicanism values 
    dialogue between clergy, laity and episcopal bodies - aiming for mutual growth and maturation. These discussions
    concede that some questions - such as those pertaining to consciousness - may require knowledge domains beyond theology.
    
    By participating in prayer, rituals, and sacramental life, believers experience both 
    human and Divine time, allowing the self to develop and awareness to deepen. Consciousness is thus a 
    dynamic process intertwined with spiritual growth and moral formation. The flow of experienced time provides space
    for spiritual growth and development through an ongoing process of sanctification.
