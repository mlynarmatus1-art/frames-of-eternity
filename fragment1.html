    In this video, we explore key Christian perspectives on consciousness and its temporal aspects. 
    Christianity distinguishes between two notions of time: Divine and Human. Divine time is boundless 
    and eternal, while Human time is linear, marked by change, decay, and the rhythms of daily life. 
    Within Anglicanism—a middle path between Catholic and Protestant traditions—this distinction is 
    experienced not only intellectually but also through sensorial, spiritual, and ritualistic practices. 
    Worship, sacraments, prayer, and liturgical calendars allow believers to step outside ordinary human time, 
    creating moments where consciousness is attuned to the eternal. Rituals like the Eucharist or seasonal feasts 
    orient the body, mind, and spirit simultaneously, shaping awareness of the self in relation to God and community. 
    Through this lived experience of time, consciousness becomes a process: the believer perceives the flow of human life 
    while participating in the timeless Divine, allowing moral reflection, spiritual growth, and sanctification to emerge. 
    In this way, time is not merely a measure but a medium through which sensorial, spiritual, and ritualistic realities 
    deepen Christian consciousness.

  <h2>Answer to the Research Question:</h2>
  <p>
    The perception of time in Christianity shapes consciousness by creating a dual awareness: temporal and eternal. 
    Through sensorial engagement, spiritual practice, and ritual observance, believers experience human time while 
    participating in Divine eternity. This layered experience molds awareness, guiding moral reflection, spiritual maturation, 
    and the ongoing sanctification of the self.
