      In this section, we explore Buddhist perspectives on consciousness through our 
      interview with Yuanyi (Eli) Yang of Amsterdam University College. Rather than treating consciousness as a single, 
      static state, Buddhist thought frames it as permanent, relational and deeply connected to non-self. We explore consciousness through a Buddhist lens, touching on time, consciousness and lived experience.

    <p>
      Importantly, non-self does not mean the absence of consciousness. Just because "I" is an abstract concept, it does not mean that there is no consciousness. By creating a concept, such as non-self, we are inherently attaching ourselves to it. Ultimately, it remains an elusive concept to be explored through our double negation of it.

    <h2>Answer to the Research Question:</h2>
    <p>
      In Buddhism, consciousness is understood through connecting with the Six Senses and Karma. By interpreting the physical senses with awareness, practitioners cultivate freedom and wisdom in their daily lives, transforming Karmic patterns.
    </p>

    <p>
      Buddhism's strength lays in its ability to combine temporal perception with awareness of said perception. By practicing Buddhist values, practitioners may become more aware of their freedom. As a prescriptive discipline, Buddhism is able to offer a framework that goes beyond a mechanistic approach. However, we do need other fields to explain the mechanistic, neural patterns that allow Buddhist practitioners to experience the senses and become aware of them.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, while Buddhism provides a religious foundation for understanding consciousness, it cannot interpret it alone. Anthropology, psychology, and neuroscience complement this foundation by showing how religious texts and philosophy is shaped by biology, symbolic meaning, and and lived experience. Consciousness emerges by combining these fields, allowing us to obtain a more comprehensive, yet still incomplete idea of it.
