  <h1>About This Project</h1>
  <p>
    This project was created for the Big Questions in Consciousness class (Autumn Semester, 2025) at Amsterdam University College by 
    Alston Kee C.Q., Simon Karacsonyi, Matus Mlynar, and Gengwei Wang.

    We explored human consciousness through neuroscience, anthropology, and theology. Our goal was to investigate 
    how time and its perception shape consciousness as experienced through sensorial, spiritual, and ritualistic realities. 
    By combining these disciplines, we highlight the value of multiple perspectives, each valid within its domain and preoccupied 
    with its own questions. The temporal aspect of our project aims to address the main tension in physicalist vs aphysicalist views, 
    rasing questions such as:
    </p>
    1, Is consciousness fixed through our life? - as defined by our physical earthly existence
    </p>
    2, Is consciousness limited to our bodily functions? 
    </p>
    3, Is perception of time in any way shaping our consciousness or vice versa?
  </p>
  <p>
    The project is presented as a series of documentary-like video fragments on a website. These fragments 
    examine consciousness from different angles: neuroscience explores sensory and temporal perception across species, showcasing
    that consciousness - as shaped by senses - may differ across species. Through religious studies (or theology),
    we examined Buddhist and Christian temporal frameworks and how they view consciousness. 
    Finally, through an autoethnographic reflection, we used anthropology to reflect on our own lived religious experiences.
  </p>
  <p>
    Methodologically, we combined literature review, interviews with religious representatives, and autoethnographic reflection. 
    This allowed us to connect scientific, ritualistic, and spiritual insights while respecting ethical considerations and participant privacy. 
    The website structure allows viewers to explore each perspective independently while seeing how they complement one another.
  </p>
  <p>
    Overall, the project demonstrates that consciousness is a multi-layered, evolving process shaped by neural mechanisms, 
    spiritual frameworks, and lived experience, highlighting the interplay between human and Divine time. Additionally, through 
    comparing multiple species in neuroscience and multiple religions, we showcase that consciousness may be a diverse phenomenon
    not only across disciplines but even from within. This shows that to explore consciousness, we always need to approach it with 
    flexible definition suited to a particular perspective. After all, similarly to time, consciousness may too be relative.
