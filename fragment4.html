    <h1>Our (Auto)Ethnography</h1>

      <p>
    This section contains video interviews of our group members. In these videos, we reflect on our conscious experience of Buddhistic
    and Christian rituals. We begin with a brief introduction and statement of our reflexivity. After this, we reflect on the experience
    of the ritual of our own culture. Then, we proceed to a reflection on a ritual of the others' culture. After this, we formulate 
    what we have experienced of points of agreement and points of tension between these two traditions. We also state how we perceived
    the flow of time during these rituals and whether this ritualistic practice - if practiced regularly - can alter our consciousness. 
    Finally, we also reflect on our experience of the project and how we see ourselves before and after its completion in line with Gestalt
    psychotherapeutic approach. 

       <p>
        
    This section directly answers our research question by integrating our knowledge and experience. First, we use our bodies as the means
    of scientific observation of the ritual - we focus on the felt experience. This method bridges over the felt experience with our subjective
    perception which we discussed in the neuroscience section. The answers to the research question in our interviews are sequential. We do not
    formulate specific answers; instead, we describe our process and the whole experience, leaving the definitive answer to the research question
    up to each other and our viewers. 
<p>
    Enjoy the reflections!
