    <h1>Our (Auto)Ethnography</h1>
    <p>
      This section contains video interviews of our group members. In these videos, we reflect on our conscious experience of Buddhistic
      and Christian rituals. We begin with a brief introduction and statement of our reflexivity. After this, we reflect on the experience
      of the ritual of our own culture. Then, we proceed to a reflection on a ritual of the others' culture. After this, we formulate 
      what we have experienced of points of agreement and points of tension between these two traditions. We also state how we perceived
      the flow of time during these rituals and whether this ritualistic practice—if engaged in regularly—can alter our consciousness. 
      Finally, we also reflect on our experience of the project and how we see ourselves before and after its completion in line with Gestalt
      psychotherapeutic approach.
    </p>

    <p>
      This section directly answers our research question by integrating our knowledge and experience. First, we use our bodies as the means
      of scientific observation of the ritual—we focus on the felt experience. This method bridges over the felt experience with our subjective
      perception which we discussed in the neuroscience section. The answers to the research question in our interviews are sequential. We do not
      formulate specific answers; instead, we describe our process and the whole experience, leaving the definitive answer to the research question
      up to each other and our viewers.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thus, as the main answer to our research question, our autoethnographic reflections show that consciousness cannot be reduced to a single definition, 
      nor can it be understood from one disciplinary vantage point alone. Instead, consciousness emerges as a relational, situated, and embodied process. 
      Through ritual participation, we experienced shifts in attention, emotion, and temporal perception that neither theology nor neuroscience could fully articulate 
      on their own. The Buddhist and Christian practices we engaged in both disrupted our habitual sense of self and reoriented our awareness—
      - yet they did so through different symbolic, sensory, and narrative frameworks. 
      These lived experiences revealed that consciousness is shaped through meaning-making, embodiment, and community as much as through neural processes.

      Together with the findings from our theological, neuroscientific, and anthropological sections, this suggests that consciousness 
      is best understood as an interplay between biological mechanisms, cultural symbols, and personal experience. 
      Rather than offering a final or universal definition, our project highlights that each framework illuminates different dimensions of what it means to be aware, 
      to perceive time, and to inhabit a world. The answer, therefore, is not a conclusion but an invitation to hold these perspectives together—to see consciousness as dynamic, 
      multifaceted, and continually formed at the intersection of body, brain, and ritual.
