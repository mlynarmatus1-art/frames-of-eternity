      In this section, we explore neuroscientific perspectives on consciousness through insights from our 
      interview with Dr. Ruud van den Bos of Radboud University. Rather than treating consciousness as a single, 
      static state, van den Bos frames it as a biologically grounded process—dynamic, adaptive, and inseparable from 
      sensory perception, emotion, behaviour, and temporal awareness. Because this process unfolds continuously and 
      is shaped by context, no single “snapshot” can fully capture consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Importantly, van den Bos’ approach also extends beyond humans. Many non-human species possess rich sensory 
      systems and temporal resolutions that may allow them to experience the world with a level of awareness as intense—if not 
      more intense—than humans. Birds, for example, perceive ultraviolet light and process visual information at much faster rates, 
      resulting in a perceptual world fundamentally different from ours. Similarly, behaviours such as elephants mourning their dead 
      show that ritual-like, emotionally charged actions are not unique to humans. Such examples highlight how neuroscience may 
      converge with anthropology when studying meaning, behaviour, and awareness across species.

    <h2>Answer to the Research Question:</h2>
    <p>
      In neuroscience, consciousness is best understood as an ongoing continuum—a dynamic process rather than a fixed state. 
      While some underlying neural mechanisms may be invariant, the qualitative experience of consciousness varies widely not only 
      across species but also among individuals. These variations influence temporal perception. For instance, our simulation of “bird 
      vision” illustrates how faster visual processing can produce a subjective dilation of time compared to human perception. 
      Recognising these differences shows why a relativistic—rather than strictly anthropocentric—framework is essential for studying consciousness.
    </p>

    <p>
      Temporal perception, however, constitutes only one dimension of conscious experience. Organisms possess multiple sensory channels 
      through which they may become aware of their environment, each contributing differently to the process of conscious awareness. 
      Neuroscience, as a largely descriptive (rather than prescriptive) discipline, offers mechanistic and correlational insights into these 
      processes. Rituals illustrate this clearly: neuroscience can measure their neural correlates, yet the purpose and meaning of rituals lie 
      beyond neural activity alone.
    </p>

    <p>
      Consequently, while neuroscience provides the essential mechanistic foundation for understanding consciousness, it cannot 
      stand alone. Anthropology, psychology, and theology complement this foundation by revealing how biological mechanisms are 
      embedded within lived experience, symbolic meaning, and interpretative frameworks. Consciousness emerges at the intersection 
      of these disciplines—a multidimensional process shaped by brain, body, context, culture, and meaning.
