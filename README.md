# frames-of-eternity
Interdisciplinary art project exploring time perception through interactive media.

## Project Description:
Throughout the course, we engaged with the concept of human consciousness through the lens of neuroscience, anthropology and literature. Each of these disciplines brought a unique perspective on consciousness. Following this structure, our project aims to show the co-existence of neuroscientific, anthropological and theological enquiries into the nature of sensory consciousness in the context of time perception. We will, thus, use these 3 disciplines to answer our research question: How does the perception of time shape consciousness as experienced through sensorial, spiritual, and ritualistic realities?
By combining theological, anthropological and neuroscientific perspectives, we underscore multidisciplinarity as an existence of equally valid perspectives – if applied within relevant knowledge domains. To achieve this, we will use a medium of several documentary-like clips presented as fragments on a website. These clips will mirror a literature review, providing answers to our research questions from the perspective of neuroscience (by relativising sensory perception across species), theology (by offering the views of Buddhism and Christianity) and anthropology (autoethnography of the project authors who use their senses within the mental religious frameworks). To explore the basis of our approaches, we reviewed relevant sources as a basis for our subsequent work.
